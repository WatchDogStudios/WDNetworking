# ezNetworking
Multiplayer-based Networking Library for ezEngine (and any "ezEngine-based" fork). Has a Source Engine like networking structure.

# Why create this?

Currently, ezEngine does not have any high-level networking solution for games. to be fair, it does have enet as a networking library, that can fulfill this requirement, but isnt really conveinent for people who just want a simple api that they can use for their projects.

# TODO: Build Process

# Third Party Libs

 - GameNetworkingSockets (Helps with intergrating with steam, we also use a modified version for this for consoles)
 - OpenSSL (GNS uses this)
 - SteamWEBRTC

# Console Support 
In-terms of console support, first you would need to contact valve for access to their Console specific repos. they are stingy about it, and state that they are working with platform holders to give it out.

We recommend looking on XGD,DevNet,NDN for respective console specific code.

We will be happy to provide console specific versions after verification. contact: contact@wdstudios.tech for more information. this is free.
